GNOME is the only desktop that secures privileged wayland protocols like screencopy. KDE and Sway have plans to fix this. <sup>[KDE](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/issues/7)</sup> <sup>[Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/2333)</sup> This means that on non-GNOME systems, applications can access screen content of the entire desktop. This implicitly includes the content of other applications. It's primarily for this reason that GNOME images are recommended.
