# INSECURE DNS CONFIGURATION
#
# This config is needed to make Captive Portals work.
# It will use the DNS Server advertized over DHCP,
# and allows exploitations like redirecting HTTP requestsy
# which are the foundation of Captive Portals.
#
# Only use this for logging in to public Networks using Captive Portals,
# and address complaints to the providers.
#
# You can change configurations like this:
# sudo mv /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/securedns.conf /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/securedns.conf.off
# sudo mv /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/insecuredns.conf.off /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/insecuredns.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-resolved
#
# And then revert like this:
# sudo mv /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/securedns.conf.off /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/securedns.conf
# sudo mv /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/insecuredns.conf /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/insecuredns.conf.off
# systemctl restart systemd-resolved
